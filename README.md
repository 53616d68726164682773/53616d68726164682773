- 👋 Hi, I’m Francis S.
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Astrophysics & Applied Space Science Engineering (ASSE), mechanical clocks & watches, innovations/inventions, cycling, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Astrophysics, reskilling on CAD (lapsed use of), picking-up forgotten coding ability from ZX Spectrum BASIC to Python & C; startring to learn Rust (slowly, time permitting).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on CubeSat/TrunkSat: programming, space junk collection, astroid detection and deflection... also small robotics including solving rubik cube, etc. Rockets are great too so I'll be putting up a collabration project via British Interplanetary Society (BIS).
- 📫 How to reach me via webform https://fsomers.xyz/contact/.
-  I’m formally educated in various sciences, including Behavioural, Computing, Engineering (electromechanical {applied physics}) & I’m slowly working my way through Astrophysics (a bit start-stop-repeat currently… Covid, etc.). I’m a member of The Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) and The British Interplanetary Society (BIS). You can find more information about me here https://fsomers.xyz/home/. 
- More stuff to come...
